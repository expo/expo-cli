# Expo Developer Tools

Expo Dev Tools is a web browser based control panel included in Expo CLI.

Expo Developer Tools supports:

- viewing logs from supporting services, (React Native Packager)
- viewing logs from your device
- publishing your project
- debugging connectivity

## Developing

- Run `yarn dev ./path/to/expo-project`. Make sure that an `expo-cli` instance is not currently running in that directory, as this script will handle running the project for you.
- Your browser should open to `http://localhost:19002/` which is the DevTools UI you are currently developing for.
