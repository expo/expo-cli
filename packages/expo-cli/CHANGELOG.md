## [50.0.0] - 2018-03-15

### Added

* [#102](https://github.com/expo/exp/pull/102) Add ability to block/wait until standalone build succeeds or fails ([@mglagola](https://github.com/mglagola))

  `exp build:android` and `exp build:ios` now automatically wait until the build has finished â€“ no need to manually poll for the status. To disable waiting, run with `--no-wait`.

* [#103](https://github.com/expo/exp/pull/103) Add `exp url:apk` and `exp url:ipa` commands for looking up Android and iOS binary URLs after building a standalone app. ([@mglagola](https://github.com/mglagola))

* Add `--max-workers [num]` option to `exp publish`.

  You can use this to limit the number of workers Metro uses when building the app, e.g. if you're running `exp publish` on a CI server that has a smaller number of CPUs available than reported by the operating system.

* [#96](https://github.com/expo/exp/pull/96) Add release channel to the output of `exp publish` ([@dozoisch](https://github.com/dozoisch))
* [#100](https://github.com/expo/exp/pull/100) Add timestamps to log output. ([@wKovacs64](https://github.com/wKovacs64))

### Changed

* `--non-interactive` option is now automatically enabled for all commands, if stdout is not a terminal. (E.g. on a continuous integration server.)
* `exp url` now aborts, if the `exp` server is not running, instead of returning an incorrect URL.
* `exp detach` command now prompts for iOS `bundleIdentifier` and Android `package` unless found in `app.json`.
* Fix `exp build:ios` failing when installation path has a space in it.

### Removed

* [#97](https://github.com/expo/exp/pull/97) Remove alias `-c` for `--release-channel` from `exp build` commands, because it conflicted with the alias for `--clear`. ([@dozoisch](https://github.com/dozoisch))
* `exp login --github` is temporarily disabled, while we migrate to the new authentication system. Please use username and password to login for now.
