/*
  All imports of XDL modules *within* XDL should be imported from this module.
  This file exists so that we can control the loading order of modules: without
  it circular dependencies that are used during module execution will cause
  hard-to-fix errors where the constant or function imported is undefined,
  because the module involved in a circular dependency hasn't been fully loaded
  at the time it's used.

  With this module in place, we can fix these circular dependency problems by
  changing the order in this file.
