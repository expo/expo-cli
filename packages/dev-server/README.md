# dev-server

A React Native development server.

This package is used by Expo CLI to run a development server for React Native apps. It is built on [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) (a JavaScript bundler) and [`@react-native-community/cli-server-api`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/tree/master/packages/cli-server-api) (the HTTP and WebSocket API for native React apps to interface with the development server).
