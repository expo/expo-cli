# expo-optimize

This package has been deprecated. There are many tools which specialize in optimizing images for hosting on the web. We recommend using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) or [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-cli).

To save on hosting costs, you should always optimize your images and other assets. Be sure to use optimal assets before deploying to [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/).
