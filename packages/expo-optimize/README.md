<!-- Body -->

This library uses the natively powered package [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) behind the scenes to optimally reduce your project's assets for use in an app or website.

üëã **Notice:** This package is not limited to Expo projects! This can be used with projects bootstrapped with community CLIs like [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) by Infinite Red, or [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) by the React Native community.

## üöÄ Usage

```sh
# Run this once to install the sharp image processing utility.
# If this cannot be installed on your computer then you won't be able to optimize images.
npm install -g sharp-cli

# To optimize images simply run this
npx expo-optimize <project-directory> [options]
```

## ü§î Why?

We created `optimize` to improve our docs and websites (Next, Gatsby, React), and our native apps (React & Expo). Optimizing images can noticeable improve your native app and website's **TTI** (or time-to-interaction) which means less time on splash screens and quicker delivery over poor network connections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

For more information run `npx expo-optimize --help` (or `-h`)
