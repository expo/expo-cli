This package wraps `electron-webpack` and adds support for Expo web and other universal React packages.

## üèÅ Setup

- Install the package in your project: `yarn add @expo/electron-adapter`
- Create a new `electron-webpack` config file: `touch ./electron-webpack.js`
- Replace the contents of your config with the following:

  `electron-webpack.js`

  ```js
  const { withExpoAdapter } = require('@expo/electron-adapter');

  module.exports = withExpoAdapter({
    projectRoot: __dirname,
    // Provide any overrides for electron-webpack: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack/blob/master/docs/en/configuration.md
  });
  ```

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Usage

### Starting a project

- Start the project with `yarn expo-electron start`
  - Currently this is just an alias for the following script: `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS=1 electron-webpack dev`
  - `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS=1` disables the useless warnings in your project.

### Customizing the main process

- To reveal the main process (highly recommended) use: `yarn expo-electron customize`
  - This will generate the `electron/main/` and `electron/webpack.config.js` files for you to customize.
  - Everything running in the `electron/main/` folder is on a different process to the rest of your app. Think of this like the native code in the Expo Client app (but not really because it's JavaScript and easy).
- To revert back to the default main process or reset to the latest default template simply delete the `electron/` folder and the adapter will go back to using the hidden version.

### Building your project

`@expo/electron-adapter` doesn't do anything to streamline building Expo Electron projects just yet. But until it does here is a guide for building projects using [`electron-builder`](https://www.electron.build/).

- Install the package with `yarn add -D electron-builder`
- Use the builder with: `yarn electron-webpack && yarn electron-builder --dir -c.compression=store -c.mac.identity=null` (`-c.compression=store` speeds the builds up a lot, delete this for actual production builds)
- Learn more about configuring your build here: [Configuring electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration)

## ü•® Behavior

- Expo resolves files with `.electron.js` & `.web.js` extensions in that order. If you want to use `electron` features then put them in a file like `foo.electron.js`.
- Every universal package you have installed will be transpiled automatically, this includes packages that start with the name: `expo`, `@expo`, `@unimodules`, `@react-navigation`, `react-navigation`, `react-native`. You can add more by appending them to the array for key `expo.web.build.babel.include` in your `app.json` (this feature is experimental and subject to change).

## License

The Expo source code is made available under the [MIT license](LICENSE). Some of the dependencies are licensed differently, with the BSD license, for example.
